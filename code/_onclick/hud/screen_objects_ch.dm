//Invesitgating a runtime made me discover that all simplemobs have HUD on hands set to themselves
//Which cause this original code to die because the mob does not have a mymob var...
//So yeah this is why we now check if it is type of mob first...
//Is this pretty? Fuck no, but its how i know to fix it -shark
//Oh also the swap button on simple mob hands has hud set to null so we also need to catch that.
