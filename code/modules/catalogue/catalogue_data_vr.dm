	desc = "A pelagic species hailing from the Barkalis system originally \
	the akula have been incidentally uplifted by the FTU \
	sharing much of their more modern culture with interstellar \
	humanity. Many of them have spread among the stars, either \
	in the nomad or joining colonies as capable hard labour." //CHOMPedit

/datum/category_item/catalogue/fauna/sergal
	name = "Sapients - Sergal"
	desc = "The dominant species in the Vilous system, the sergals are a \
	strange mammalian clade which shares similarities with \
	masurpials, pelagic creatures and wolves. Collectivist and \
	organising themselves in tribes and city states, they have \
	eclipsed the private colony venture trying to hold them \
	economically beholden and now have joined the galactic \
	stage as a minor power." //CHOMPedit

/datum/category_item/catalogue/fauna/nevrean
	name = "Sapients - Nevrean"
	desc = "A co-sapient species from Vilous, the nevreans have found their \
	ecological niche as nomadic traders and craftsmen, \
	developing a rich oral tradition that is being slowly \
	codified by the sergals in an efforts to culturally export \
	it through the stars. The modern nevrean co-inhabits most \
	sergal territory as comrades and historical allies." //CHOMPedit

/datum/category_item/catalogue/fauna/rapala
	name = "Sapients - Rapala"
	desc = "The rapala, formally “Rapala-Unathi” are a vassal species of the unathi \
	in form of winged Humanoids. While they share a similar outwards appearance with humans, \
	they have a much more complex system of sexual genetics, as well superior 3D awareness. \
	The rapala act as emissaries, diplomats and spies for their overlords, although it is an open \
	secret that they work for more autonomy and self-governance." //CHOMPedit

/datum/category_item/catalogue/fauna/xenochimera
	name = "Sapients - Xenochimera"
	desc = "ERROR : DNA corruption detected. The likely outcome of this is this specimen being \
	a xenochimera. Xenochimeras are the end stage of “Roanoke Syndrome”, a microbial infection \
	that infiltrates the immune system of a host species by mimicking cells. Upon expiration of \
	the host (preventable by medical attention), the cells cannibalize and take over the body, \
	creating a xenochimera. If the body has been capable of sapient thought, the resultant morph \
	is also capable of thought. \
	<br> <br>\
	Contrary to popular belief, Roanoke Syndrome colonies do not seek out sapient life. Any exposure \
	is incidental and not part of a plot – xenochimera without sapient thought are simply wild animals or disease vectors." //CHOMPedit

/datum/category_item/catalogue/fauna/vulpkanin
	name = "Sapients - Vulpkanin"
	desc = "The vulpkanin are the remnants of an ancient precursor race, residing on a planet called \
	“Altam”. Vulpkanin diverged from the precursors due to heavy isolation after the fall, \
	presumably due to being a freshly found colony. A lack of material support regressed their technology \
	to pre-industrial standards until being found again by humanity. At this point \
	they have formed an early spacefaring society and smoothly entered the galacic stage. \
	Vulpkanin are the closest successor to the precursors, genetically, although genelocked devices still do not \
	recognize them due to genetic drift." //CHOMpedit

	name = "Sapients - Alraune"
	desc = "Alraune are enigmatic, strange creatures from the Elysian system. While their main culture is still \
	in the early neolithic, a large diaspora has formed from previous abductions and trade with these creatures, who \
	seem to mimic many cultivars throughout space through yet an unknown mechanism. Alraune are pleasant, but \
	predatorily autocannibalize their own products as a form of nutriment transfer and storage." //CHOMPedit

	name = "Sapients - Vasilissan"
	desc = "Vasilissans are an arachnid species uplifted by NT due to their propensity for architectural feats for \
	surface-to-orbit buildings with relatively primitive materials. Exploited for a while, they have managed to \
	connect to the wider galactic stage and circumvent further TSC exploitation. \
	Vasilissans are frequently adopted into foreign colonies, valued for their infrastructural acumen \

	name = "Sapients - Zorren"
	desc = "The zorren are the remnants of an ancient precursor race, residing on a planet called “Menhir” \
	but known to SolGov as Virgo 4. Zorren organise themselves through various feudal-styled kingdoms and monarchies, \
	of which the most prominent is the Kingdom of An-Tahk-Et. They are obsessed over their ancient heritage \
	and the power of the noble houses comes through the control and excavation of old technology \
	of their precursors, leading to a massive divide between commoners and the nobility." //CHOMPedit

/datum/category_item/catalogue/fauna/altevian
	name = "Sapients - Altevian"
	desc = "The Altevian are a species of tall, rodent humanoids that are akin to rats for their features. \
	The Altevian, unlike most species, do not have a home planet, nor system, adopting a fully nomadic lifestyle \
	for their survival across the stars. Instead, they have opted to live in massive super capital-class colony-ships \
	with a flagship as their place they would call home."

	Specimen NT-495. \
	<br> <br>\
	NT-495, also colloquial known as “Shadekin”, “Deep People”, “Mar Beast”, “Shadow creature” are an enigmatic species \
	capable of localized bluespace events (although the credibility of them actually manipulating bluespace effects \
	still is in question), allowing them to “shift” through phases of existence without assistance of machines. \

	Resleeving creates near perfect copies of a body within a database, capable of uploading user consciousness \
	into a dormant brain via direct electro-uploading. The technology remains imperfect and \
