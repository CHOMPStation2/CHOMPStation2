	data = "Situated 10 lightseconds from the system's primary, Borealis Majoris is - in the politest terms - a frozen hellhole. With surface temperatures " + span_italics("peaking") + " at a bone-chilling -30 celsius (-22 fahrenheit) but dropping as low as -80 C (-112 F) if not lower on the planet's dark side, the planet's primary redeeming features include its abundance of oxygen and phoron. Its atmosphere hovers between 90 and 110 kPa, and consists of 72% O2, 2% CO2, and 24% N2, with other trace gases. Due to the low temperatures, the vast majority of the planet's phoron is found crystallized underground, or within the flora and fauna, the substance presumably making its way into the wildlife via what little hardy vegetation clings to the planet's surface, mostly mosses and lichens.\
	<br><br>\
	Despite the fact that Borealis Majoris is near-constantly lashed by swirling blizzards, howling winds, vicious hailstorms, and icy rain, it is nonetheless host to a handful of colonies and outposts, the largest and most prosperous of which is the NT-operated NSC " + span_italics("Cryogaia") + "."

Its phoron deposits are located deep underground if they are present at all on the moon, and so mining operations have focused on Borealis Majoris itself rather than on the relatively resource-poor moon."

Whilst it's a relatively small operation in the grand scheme of things and is constantly under threat from all manner of angry wildlife, the sheer volume of phoron available makes the installation extremely profitable; enough for NT to maintain a dedicated Asset Response Annex aboard the NCS " + span_italics("Serenity") + ", ready to deploy at a moment's notice should a major threat appear.\
	<br><br>\
	The half-subterranean " + span_italics("Cryogaia") + " installation is considered a work in progress, and undergoes renovations and updates on a relatively frequent but highly erratic basis. Notably, it is built on one of the few natural hot springs available on the planet, though NT has opted to use another of its Supermatter Research-Reactors backed up by solar arrays, in lieu of a more conventional geothermal power plant for the time being."

It also includes crew relief facilities for Cryogaia's personnel, and handles the vast majority of interplanetary traffic in the system.
