	// Phoron dragons are a discovery by NT that was quickly classified when archeological dig sites near phoron deposits found strange crystalized skeletal remains.
	// Following the trails of these discoveries simultaneously lead to large phoron deposits and the rare discovery of live phoron dragons at the same time.
	// Most mining sites established by NT are pre-scouted for the express purpose of extermination and destruction of evidence in order to protect the discovery and the mining operations.
	// Considered extremely territorial, dangerous, and jealous of other dragons; making lairs and nests hidden and embedded in extremely volcanic areas or locations abundant of heavy minerals.
	// Claws are sometimes described to be strong as durasteel, always sharp and cold no matter their environment, traces of which can be found in unbelievably sharp religious artifacts
	// Although their signature is unique, the overexposure of radioactive energy and conductive metal make it almost impossible to use conventional scanning methods on the creature.
	// Their metallic and crystal diet is extremely demanding and hard to maintain, they're also known to supplement their diet with minerals found in living creatures.
	// Rumor has it that they create phoron as a complex nuclear chemical combination reaction and are believed but were never officially found to be a major source of it.
	// Their age varies drastically based on their diet, larger phoron dragons growing from overconsumption need more to be sustained and result in a shorter life span.
	// DNA results suggest other dragons devolved from phoron dragons when dietary requirements couldn't be met and meat sources had to be relied upon, causing 'inert' dragons.
	// Slime farming technologies and their ability to create phoron are actually a derivative science of studying phoron dragon digestive fluids.
	// Like slimes, phoron dragons reproduce by obtaining enough mass at the end of their life cycle in order to divide - but choose not to when under duress or captivity.
	// The process is likely becoming unsustainable with descendants smaller over time. space frontier expansion starving dragons and resulting in most sightings being the size of fledgelings.
