/////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////CHOMPEDIT Custom shadekin mini tutorial
//Proto shadekin; AKA; Basic how to make your own shadekin; -Shark

//Step 1; sprites;
//File for body = icons/mob/vore_shadekin.dmi
//File for tail = icons/mob/vore_shadekin64.dmi
//Sprites can be either made inside of DM or you can use a Program of your choice and save the files as PNG and then import them
//If you need help learning how to use DMs interface to import/export sprites and make states you can always ask in the discord.

//Step 2; Code
//Now this depends on what type of eye colour you want
//For a red we use
///mob/living/simple_animal/shadekin/red
//then we simply add our shadekins name at the end (unless its used already)
/mob/living/simple_mob/shadekin/red/proto
	name ="Proto"
	//This here will be our shadekins name

	desc = "An invisible entity not meant for use."
	//here goes a lil tidbit people can see when examining the shadekin. Multiple lines works just as on the vore part

	icon_state = "proto"
	//this will most likely also be your shadekins name, it corresponds to the name you gave the tail and body state in the DMIs
	//so if you named the body state "proto" and "proto-1" then icon_state should be called "proto"

	vore_stomach_flavor = "You stared into the void,\
	the void decided you look tasty,\
	now you are in the void, pretty wet"
	//This is what people see when they drop into your gut! the backslashes at the end of the sentence indicate the next text will be on its own line!


	player_msg = "Proto is you, Proto shouldn't exist"
	//This message pops up when you are put into your shadekin
	//I recommend you use it as a way to remind yourself of how you want to act generally as your shadekin.

//Step 3; PR
// Assuming you already have a Fork of chompstation, make sure you got your files in order
// and then simply make a new pull request to our github.

//Now once you pushed the new DMIs with your added sprites to our github.
//And you finished writing this code section for your shadekin and pushed that too. You are done.
//If this is your first time I recommend getting someone to look over your work.

	your body as the humid air rises across the deeper you slide into the darkness of her stomach. As you splash \
	inside, you curl up comfortably inside the walls that churn and squeeze around you, any fidgeting quickly \
	subdued by the strength of the walls, and any movement of your predator seems to coax a light sway from \
	your current prison. The slime inside stuck fairly well, though harmless - your aches and pains slowly soothing \
	up and fading away."

	cramming your torso into his maw and taking wet SCHLURP, GLUK, to get it down and up to your waist. Roti continues to taste you all over wanting that succulent flavor \
	to himself. Another loud wet swallow and down goes your waist into his hungry maw, lifting up the legs high into the sky while allowing gravity and his gulps \
	to send you packing away into his chubby gut that now expands to fit you inside of the wet chamber. At least you were safe for now that is."

	While he may have a more padded out soft build below, the masculine part of them is quite visible as a large fat furred sack and sheath rests comfortably between his thighs. \
