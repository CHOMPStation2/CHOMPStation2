/*
#    An explaination of the naming format for guns and ammo:
#
#    a = Ammo, as in individual rounds of ammunition.
#    b = Box, intended to have ammo taken out one at a time by hand.
#    c = Clips, intended to reload magazines or guns quickly.
#    m = Magazine, intended to hold rounds of ammo.
#    s = Speedloaders, intended to reload guns quickly.
#
#    Use this format, followed by the caliber. For example, a shotgun's caliber
#    variable is "12g" as a result. Ergo, a shotgun round's path would have "a12g",
#    or a magazine with shotgun shells would be "m12g" instead. To avoid confusion
#    for developers and in-game admins spawning these items, stick to this format.
#    Likewise, when creating new rounds, the caliber variable should match whatever
#    the name says.
#
#    This comment is copied in magazines.dm as well.
