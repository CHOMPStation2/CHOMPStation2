  Missile597:
  - rscadd: Added shield diffusers to airlocks at the docks
  - rscadd: Added shield diffusers around a few point defence turrets so that their
      diagonal angles don't get blocked off by shields.
  - rscadd: Added a powernet sensor for the mains (master) grid and tweaked the names
      of a few others.
  - rscadd: Added a few meters onto pipes in the supermatter engine that could be
      useful, and I forgot to add some before
  - rscdel: Trimmed some redundant wires around shield gens
  - qol: Increased the amount of signs around shield gen rooms to make them more obvious
      and easier to find
  - balance: Closed the hole above misc science with glass for the meantime to prevent
      easy break-ins
  - bugfix: Added terminals to the cell rack PSU's in engineering so they can actually
      recharge now. Removed a few of them though cause they had way too many.
  - bugfix: Fixed the shutters in Xenobio to be solid and opaque instead of see through
      at round start.
  - bugfix: Fixed the oxygen tank in atmos that had the vent and injector the wrong
      way around
  - bugfix: Fixed a valve and adaptor that were the wrong way around in the command
      emergency atmos station
  - maptweak: Remapped the centre shield gen spot to be ready to hook up to mains
  - maptweak: Remapped the secondary engine airlock to be a bit more effective at
      cycling in AND out without wasting air (hopefully).
  - maptweak: Properly isolated the dorms area with it's own private distro and returned
      the southern side of the map to the distro loop which had been previously disconnected
      (previously dorms were still connected to the southern station parts including
      parts of medical, but the whole of these rooms were cut off from distro. Now
      it's all reconnected except specifically deck 3's dorm rooms which feed from
      their own atmos tank)
  - maptweak: Replaced the air tank in engineering's suit storage with an oxygen tank
      so it can be used for internals refill
  - spellcheck: Fixed a typo in the CE office, RIP emergecny bag of holding
