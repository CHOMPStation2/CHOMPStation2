2024-09-24:
  Missile597:
  - rscadd: Added railings to many areas in maintenance which were missing them causing
      easy fall risk, especially around ladders. Maints is now 90% more Space OSHA
      approved!
  - rscadd: Added lattices above the dock areas where maints trash exists. Hopefully
      this should keep the mice and raccoons safe.
  - rscadd: Gave the AI a light switch so they don't have to live in a dark basement
  - rscdel: Deleted the signs on deck 3 for a transit tube that did not exist, and
      filled in the missing emergency shutter
  - rscdel: Deleted the APC in the abandoned chapel. Area doesn't need power anyway
      and if someone wants to power it they can build their own APC. It wasn't wired
      up anyway.
  - rscdel: Removed the AI entertainment monitors. AI doesn't like TV anyway and they
      were blocking intercoms
  - rscdel: Removed the nitrous anaesthetic from Robotics
  - qol: The command office request consoles are now allowed to make station announcements
  - qol: Gave the kitchen their booze back
  - qol: Gives engineering a light replacer tool
  - qol: Added plating under the catwalks on the tesla platform so borgs can go for
      a space walk
  - bugfix: Fixed a couple of bypass breakers with wires underneath still, bypassing
      the bypass.
  - bugfix: Fixed a disposals bin above the botanical kitchen that wasn't connected
      to the network
  - bugfix: Added a missing connector for the airlock tanks on the secondary engine
      airlock
  - bugfix: Replaced airless plating in toxins lab with some breathable air.
  - bugfix: Fixed the air alarm naming conventions
  - bugfix: Hopefully fixed persistent storages (though can't test this). Locations
      of storages are up for debate but given the location of the qpad, I think cargo
      could benefit from a transit tube in future updates
  - bugfix: 'Fixed the terrain below medical that was having shields generated on
      it (lost the Sif look for now)

      fix; Fixed the AI chamber wiring being back to front and causing the AI to die
      at round start'
  - bugfix: Fixed some powernet sensors that weren't connected to the subgrids properly
      and added a distinction for outpost R-UST Input and Output grids. Deleted a
      doubled up engineering sensor.
  - maptweak: Remapped the supermatter cold loop to be a bit more beginner-friendly
      for modifications as well as making it flow better normally. Feel free to play
      with the setup in-round though!
  - maptweak: Replaced two Nitrogen canisters with phoron canisters in the supermatter
      gas storage (4 nitrogen 4 phoron to 2 nitrogen 6 phoron). Nitrogen gets used
      a lot more rarely and surprisingly few phoron canisters about. This should be
      a better QoL change for SM engines.
  - maptweak: Replaced engineering's advanced shield equipment with basic ones, so
      cargo still had one more reason to exist.
  - maptweak: Recoloured the secondary engine output wires from pink to yellow to
      differentiate it from the primary engine. This will be particularly useful later
      with plans I have for shield gens at some point-. Also recoloured the coils
      left for setup to cyan and yellow to match the wires in use in that area.
  - maptweak: Closed off a few drop vore spots that allowed too easy access to restricted
      areas with glass. You can still see and break in to eat people but no easy dropping
      in and printing whatever you want off the protolathe. Some less secure spots
      are left unprotected and have some lattices to allow escape, and I did the same
      with the public area spots as well.
  - maptweak: Rewired the solar APCs to run off mains so they don't shut down the
      airlocks when solars aren't working. Added an extra coil to the Eastern SMES
      to allow them to cope with the additional load from the extra arrays.
  - maptweak: Gave the bar pretty see-through shutters so it looks less industrial
      while closed
  - maptweak: Replaced the SM doors and blast doors with ones that shouldn't melt
      so easy this time. Also the doors should be obvious that they're bolted now.
  - maptweak: Set the secondary engine power supply SMES output to off at round start
      so it doesn't drain all it's power before the second engine can be set up.
  TheCaramelion:
  - rscadd: Food replicator machine
  - qol: Graffitis will take your mouse position now
  Verkister:
  - qol: Disabled bellysprite vis plane separation until a less destructive method
      for hiding other people's bellysprites is available.
  tacoguy7765093:
  - maptweak: Removed floating button in medbay maints
  - maptweak: Reduced steel/glass in all 4 tool staroages having more material then
      engineering
  - maptweak: Replaced chemistry roof catwalks with plating, as players could 'climb
      down through' catwalks
  - maptweak: Removed ERT level hardsuits for janitors (Why do janitors have hardsuits
      in the first place??)
  - maptweak: Replaces SPACE STON 13 with generic NT logo for now
  - maptweak: Makes 'public suit cyclers' actually public
  - maptweak: Makes medbay less G R E E N
  - maptweak: Removed floating medbay chunk
  - maptweak: Xenobio airlocks work now
  - bugfix: Fixes radio being broadcasted twice
