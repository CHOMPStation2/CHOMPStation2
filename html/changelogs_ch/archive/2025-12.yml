  - maptweak: Added two low-power pumps (preset to default portable pump pressure)
      to the portable pump connectors to prevent backflow and overpressure into the
      line. This will make upgrades or edits to the line much less of a safety hazard
      to crew health. Also applied these changes to backup atmos.
  - maptweak: Mirrored the layout of both large escape pods.
  - maptweak: The HoS, Warden, and Captain have pinpointers in their lockers now.
