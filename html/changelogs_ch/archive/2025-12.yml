2025-12-03:
  CHOMPStation2StaffMirrorBot:
  - rscadd: fusion coils can explode if shot by damaging guns; one hit is fine, two
      will make them detonate. damaged coils have their charge cap halved. unstable
      coils can still be safely discharged, which will also mean they won't explode
      if hit again.
  - qol: fusion coils glow in the dark to make them easier to find
  - balance: fusion coils are heavier and incur more slowdown
  - image: fusion coil sprite tweaks
  Guti:
  - refactor: Improved filling cabinet UI and makes use of span_bold

2025-12-07:
  CHOMPStation2StaffMirrorBot:
  - code_imp: update dependencies
  Diana:
  - qol: You can now alt-shift click someone to open the inventory menu (as if you
      drag-dropped them onto yourself)
  - qol: Admins can now tag datums via ctrl-middle click
  - refactor: Honey I refactored click code!
  - code_imp: Cleans up click code.

      to be dragged

      made (still happens) causing you to be rate limited.
  FluffMedic:
  - rscadd: Two new Tyr weapons
  - balance: Tyr gun buffed, Tyr foes retuned a fair bit to favour longer fights
  - bugfix: Shield boss stops spamming re-shielding
2025-12-10:
  CHOMPStation2StaffMirrorBot:
  - rscadd: Adds a new neutral trait 'unique mind-structure' which causes sleevemates
      to be unable to tell if you are in the proper sleeve or not!
  - bugfix: Fakedeath tag now makes you show up as DEAD to sleevemates.
  - rscadd: Generic mob spawner grenades

  Ryumi:
  - rscadd: Added a unicorn horn to character customization, (Sprite by opheliathedeadful
      on Discord.)
  VictorZisthus:
  - maptweak: Updated select escape pods and shuttles with handrails and floor-tube
      lighting to improve space efficiency. Think of it like being able to pack in
      more prey without sacrificing otherwise workable space! Most shuttles and ships
      received this change, though some only had a single handrail added near surgery
      tables where applicable.
  - maptweak: Removed a few instances of lingering xmas gear.
  - maptweak: Added a multitool to the other botany locker. Apparently hydro trays
      have a use for those. Who knew?
  - maptweak: Removed terminology relating to the first and second floors of the wilderness
      shelter, as there can be only one. Updated camera coverage around the wilderness
      shelter.
  - maptweak: Added a grinder to the dilapidated chef area above cargo.
  - maptweak: Moved the AI shell spawner, and added a second one.
  - maptweak: Fixed an issue with the engine's waste management pressure valve.

      from completely locking out the main manual Z travel method.
  - maptweak: Replaced simulated space and rocks on the centcom Z level with their
      unsimulated variants for performance.
  - maptweak: Rearranged some paperwork stuff in security and IA. Gave the IA's some
      fancy pens that can change ink colors!
  - maptweak: Buffed the command subgrid, as it powers the AI subgrid.
  - maptweak: Preset Atmos and Command subgrids to run independent of master, to better
      show folks that it's good to set that stuff up during a power surge. The lungs
      and brain of the station keep trudging on...
  - maptweak: Added two low-power pumps (preset to default portable pump pressure)
      to the portable pump connectors to prevent backflow and overpressure into the
      line. This will make upgrades or edits to the line much less of a safety hazard
      to crew health. Also applied these changes to backup atmos.
  - maptweak: Mirrored the layout of both large escape pods.
  - maptweak: The HoS, Warden, and Captain have pinpointers in their lockers now.
      They can sniff out more than just the disk. Please use them wisely or centcom
      will remove them.
  Will:
  - rscadd: Catslug belly markings for shelter gate and door
  zeskorion:
  - rscadd: maintenance panels to cetus
  - bugfix: a few cetus fixes
