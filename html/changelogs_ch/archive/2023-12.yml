  - balance: Adjusted the distillery recipe for biomass to be more in line with the
      buffed instant recipe. Recipe remains the same as before, but now distils 6

      more, whilst retaining the cost of needing to provide blood as well as using
      the distillery. (Maybe it'll see some use? Probably not)
