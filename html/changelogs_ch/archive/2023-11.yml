    - rscadd:
        Added storage tanks to deck three Atmos maintenance for waste gasses to
        scrub to.
    - rscadd:
        Connected dorms area scrubbers to the new waste tanks so that these areas
        can scrub, which should prevent atmos issues on long shifts in this area. Scrubbers
        are still isolated from the rest of the station for protection from spiderlings.
    - qol:
        Added connectors to the air and scrubber loops in deck three atmos maintenance,
        to allow a pump and scrubber to be filled/emptied here in case of emergency.
    - bugfix:

        one which had the incorrect frequency set for some reason. This should resolve
        the issue with air alarms being unable to communicate and change settings on
        vents and scrubbers in the area.

        Atmos Maintenance on deck three has been made a bit wider, to fit the

        'Added a new module for robohounds: "Robohound Capability Expansion Module",
        Material 5, Engineering 4. This module allows sleeper bellies to ingest items
        and doubles their capacity. Due to this, a sleeper belly can in combination
        with the "Robohound Capacity Expansion Module" (1 x2 x2) have a total of 4 slots.
        At all times, only one "patient" can be ingested. With the new module though,
        the space can be used for items. This allows robots to get their paws on some
        kind of "trash eating" if they want it for scening without simply adding the
        ability by default towards the sleeper modules.'
