  Missile597:
  - rscadd: Added storage tanks to deck three Atmos maintenance for waste gasses to
      scrub to.
  - rscadd: Connected dorms area scrubbers to the new waste tanks so that these areas
      can scrub, which should prevent atmos issues on long shifts in this area. Scrubbers
      are still isolated from the rest of the station for protection from spiderlings.

      to allow a pump and scrubber to be filled/emptied here in case of emergency.

      one which had the incorrect frequency set for some reason. This should resolve
      the issue with air alarms being unable to communicate and change settings on
      vents and scrubbers in the area.

      added tanks and pipework in.

      Material 5, Engineering 4. This module allows sleeper bellies to ingest items
      and doubles their capacity. Due to this, a sleeper belly can in combination
      with the "Robohound Capacity Expansion Module" (1 x2 x2) have a total of 4 slots.
      At all times, only one "patient" can be ingested. With the new module though,
      the space can be used for items. This allows robots to get their paws on some
      kind of "trash eating" if they want it for scening without simply adding the
      ability by default towards the sleeper modules.'
