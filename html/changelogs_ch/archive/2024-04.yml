  ReoDaProtovali:
  - rscadd: Added synth emotes to corrupt hounds and subtypes. *roboboop
  - rscadd: Added a maw belly to leopardmanders that autotransfers to their gut. Dunno
      what made me do that (especially since it ended up being a lot of trouble to
      get working properly)
  - rscadd: Added a whole new AI to swoopies based on nurse spiders looking for items
      to wrap. Right click an AI controlled swoopie and choose the "Change Settings"
      verb to tell the swoopie to swoop stuff!
  - rscadd: Added wrappers dropping in vorebellies if you eat and digest the whole
      food item.
  - rscadd: Added bones to merc and other humanoid corpses. (leave remains pref is
      now enabled for them!)
  - qol: Made vac-packs not ask if you want to set the destination to borg belly if
      you're not a borg
  - bugfix: Fixed throwing mobs into disposal bins. For some reason it was implemented
      but in a very shitty way that only checked for micro holders. It should work
      properly. No autoflush :(
  - image: added the secondary belly layer to the original set of vore bellies. Somehow
      we missed those and virgo had them. Now we should both have them!
