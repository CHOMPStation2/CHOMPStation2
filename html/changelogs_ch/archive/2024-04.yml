  - rscadd: Added synth emotes to corrupt hounds and subtypes. *roboboop
  - rscadd: Added a maw belly to leopardmanders that autotransfers to their gut. Dunno
      what made me do that (especially since it ended up being a lot of trouble to
      get working properly)

      to wrap. Right click an AI controlled swoopie and choose the "Change Settings"
      verb to tell the swoopie to swoop stuff!

      food item.

      properly. No autoflush :(
  - image: added the secondary belly layer to the original set of vore bellies. Somehow
      we missed those and virgo had them. Now we should both have them!
