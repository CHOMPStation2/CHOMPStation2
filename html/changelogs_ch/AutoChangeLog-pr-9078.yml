changes:
  - rscadd: "Added shield diffusers to airlocks at the docks"
  - rscadd: "Added shield diffusers around a few point defence turrets so that their diagonal angles don't get blocked off by shields."
  - rscadd: "Added a powernet sensor for the mains (master) grid and tweaked the names of a few others."
  - rscadd: "Added a few meters onto pipes in the supermatter engine that could be useful, and I forgot to add some before"
  - rscdel: "Trimmed some redundant wires around shield gens"
  - qol: "Increased the amount of signs around shield gen rooms to make them more obvious and easier to find"
  - balance: "Closed the hole above misc science with glass for the meantime to prevent easy break-ins"
  - bugfix: "Added terminals to the cell rack PSU's in engineering so they can actually recharge now. Removed a few of them though cause they had way too many."
  - bugfix: "Fixed the shutters in Xenobio to be solid and opaque instead of see through at round start."
  - bugfix: "Fixed the oxygen tank in atmos that had the vent and injector the wrong way around"
  - bugfix: "Fixed a valve and adaptor that were the wrong way around in the command emergency atmos station"
  - maptweak: "Remapped the centre shield gen spot to be ready to hook up to mains"
  - maptweak: "Remapped the secondary engine airlock to be a bit more effective at cycling in AND out without wasting air (hopefully)."
  - maptweak: "Properly isolated the dorms area with it's own private distro and returned the southern side of the map to the distro loop which had been previously disconnected (previously dorms were still connected to the southern station parts including parts of medical, but the whole of these rooms were cut off from distro. Now it's all reconnected except specifically deck 3's dorm rooms which feed from their own atmos tank)"
  - maptweak: "Replaced the air tank in engineering's suit storage with an oxygen tank so it can be used for internals refill"
  - spellcheck: "Fixed a typo in the CE office, RIP emergecny bag of holding"
