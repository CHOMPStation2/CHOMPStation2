# this file is for exempting certain groups of keys from recieving the "you're already in the game go away" message when they connect with the same IP (ie, living together)
# each group should be on the same line, separated by a comma (and nothing else), and each group should be on a separate line
# EXAMPLE (remove the # and it would be valid):
#somekey1,somekey2,somekey3
