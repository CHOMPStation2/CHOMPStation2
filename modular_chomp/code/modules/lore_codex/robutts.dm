	data = "Nanotrasen's YR3 line of chassis is a new contender on the market. Originating as a semi-permanent shell for xenochimera, the rugged construction and sleek appearance of the chassis, whilst retaining relatively simple internal design, has quickly become popular with both Nanotrasen employees and adjacent communities.\
	<br><br>\
	The YR3 shell is relatively affordable to individuals under the standard NT health plan, having been marketed as a paid upgrade to the standard NT grey look. Both the rugged Enviroshell line, and the 'Slimline' YR3 model, which fills the large internal voids with simplistic nanite pseudomuscle, offering enhanced dexterity and haptic sense, have proved somewhat popular, if overpriced. Lines of differently colored plating, and faux fur coverings, have been made available for the designs."
