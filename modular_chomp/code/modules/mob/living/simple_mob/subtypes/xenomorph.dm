// Chomp version of a xeno. Uses the thicc sprites for the queen - has a couple little custom abilities too.
// Thanks to BlackMajor for much guidance / stealing stuff from his bigdragon mob
// 06/07/2024: Sprite changes to TGMC/CM and more castes (experimental). Increased expected sprite size from 32x32 to 48x48 and 64x64 for larger castes. - Aroliacue
