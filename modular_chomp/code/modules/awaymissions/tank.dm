All the hatches have been welded shut, and the barrel has been demilled, a hole torched through it from top to bottom to make sure it'll never fire again. These are still in service today with the SCG, and produced primarily by the W-K manufacturing group, or WKHM. First saw service during the Gaian conflict."
