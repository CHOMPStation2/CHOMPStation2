//Two-ish tiers. The first tier is made from natural stuff around the caverns.
//Tier 2 armor is made from the hides and such from the dangerous wildlife.
//Whilst weapons have parts from the wildlife, and the alien ruins.
//tier 1
//Agate and wood for weapons
//cloth and something else is used for armor
//tier 2
//monster flesh for armor
//agate, alien props, and monster bits for weapons.
