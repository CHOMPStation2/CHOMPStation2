//Okay, so we have currently have four prototype
//A crystal, enginge, core and a hilt.
//So four weapons although the alien junk is interchangeable cause fun
//All tyr weapons are battery locked, and cannot have their cell changed but self recharge.
//Also short range
//So hilt, ball and chain wierd weapon. Has actual melee damage. Projectile is slow, recharge is slow, night no ammo, range of seven
//Basic medium size blaster. Range of 5. Core base
//Shotgun type weapon. Range of 3. Small knockback of foes, high damage. Engine
//Now the crystal weapon...laser Range of 4.
//Damages be funky to figure out good numbers for

//The energy ball and shot gun get 35 damage for being similair bits of high risk and high reward. the BnC will take a whilst to recharge/
//So if you miss, you're stuck with a middling melee weapon for a bit.
//Whilst the shot gun has more shots, but you need to get up closih.
//Chain gets AP whilst shotgun gets knockback
