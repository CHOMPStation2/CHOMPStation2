		Well, this is awkward.<BR>
		Lab is finally closed.<BR>
		Everyone but boss man is gone.<BR>
		Which I mean dead, quit, fired, or some combination of them.<BR>
		And well the labs are a mess, and boss man well...that strange place did things to him.<BR>
		So, I took charge and did things. I locked boss up firmly in that sphere he so fondly likes.<BR>
		Locked the armory and hid the switches within the chassis we made.<BR>,
		If someone goes looky for boss, they'll need to clear up the carnage we made <BR>
		Nothing is getting out of there. Except Ashy, they're the one sane thing left. <BR>
		Not really sure what else to do for my confession.<BR>
		We did some really messed up stuff man, and planned on doing worse.<BR>
		I think boss believes themselves to be god.<BR>
		And with that strange mecha, I don't blame them. Not sure the experimental janus designs I've seen<BR>
		surpass it.<BR>
		Soo uhhh, yeah we messed up. Imma walk off aimlessly into the desert<BR>
		Or maybe go home myself if I can bypass my own security measures<BR>
		Didn't want anyone coming in or out of the teleporter but couldn't break it<BR>
		So locked it behind a buttons in our research wings<BR>
		And hey if you're hearing this, take care of my drake please.<BR>
		Ashy is a good one.<BR>
