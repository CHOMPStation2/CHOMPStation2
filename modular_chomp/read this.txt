Hey congratulations you found the modularity folder.
What's it for? Well, chompstation is, currently, a downstream of another codebase, vorestation.
Content we write for chomp often needs to be written in such a way as to not conflict with code that comes from this upstream.

In an effort to make this easier to do, I've started our modularity folder.
Ideally, any content that can be written that is wholelly independant of vorestation's content, should be
included in this modularity folder, and put into the associated folder that it would have appeared in among the standard files.

Ideally, the point of this is to make it slightly easier to differentiate chomp specific content from virgo content.

When should you use this?
Mostly for chomp exclusive stuff, otherwise if it's expected to be a part of upstream as well, probably in the base files.
From now on, any code I completely rewrite from virgo, I'll be including in this set of folders.
