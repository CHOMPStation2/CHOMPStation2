<p><b>Assailants Battle Over Southern Cross</b></p>

<p>A firefight broke out across NLS Southern Cross this weekend, allegedly involving at least two rival mercenary factions. While NanoTrasen claims to have identified both groups, it has not offered an explanation as to why the factions targeted the station. According to crew reports, the factions apparently used the station to attack one another, treating the crew as collateral damage.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the station suffered heavy damage and casualties but reportedly less than typical. “The crew seemed to hold the line enough to fight back and deal damage to the invaders,” stated an official NT spokesperson. “We were alerted to the situation much earlier than usual and recorded less damage to the station. The ERT expected much more of a bloodbath.”</p>
<p>While not the first time Southern Cross has been a staging ground for battling mercenaries, the motives remain unclear. No faction has claimed credit for the battle, though it is worth noting the infamous Syndicate rarely takes credit for attacks which fail to deal tremendous damage to NanoTrasen installations.</p>

<p><b>Trafficking Targets NanoTrasen Crew</b></p>

<p>Reports of a trafficking ring targeting NLS Southern Cross surfaced yesterday, testing the facility’s lackluster security. Allegedly armed with teleportation devices, the perpetrators simply teleported hapless crew to a processing facility to be stripped and sold for ransom or as black-market goods. NanoTrasen maintains that any crew not recovered were resleeved but it remains unknown how many crew may now have other selves sold into slavery.</p>
<p>Commonly called “abductors,” such trafficking rings are rare on the frontier but not unheard of, resulting in many horror stories (somewhat rightfully) circulating about the fates of their victims. Whether or not such rings are part of a large organization is unknown but considered unlikely due to the rarity of such attacks.</p>
<p>The average person on Sif (or the Karan colonies, for that matter) has little to fear as such incursions are exceptionally rare outside of isolated locales. The average NT employee however would be rightfully afraid given the isolated nature of Southern Cross and the success of this weekend’s incursion. It will be up to NanoTrasen to prevent this from happening again; we all know how that will go.</p>
