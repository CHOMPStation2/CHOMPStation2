<p><b>A Safe and Productive Year (Sponsored by NanoTrasen)</b></p>

<p>The good folks at NanoTrasen have reached out to wish everybody a safe and productive year 2566. The company has continued to grow beyond quarterly projections and would thus like to thank both its dedicated Vir personnel and devoted Vir customers.</p>
<p>NanoTrasen would particularly like to thank the crew of NLS Southern Cross for keeping the station functional despite a string of unexpected disasters. NT hopes the late year visit from the Golden Space Goose sufficiently helped with unwinding and relaxing for the rest of the month.</p>
<p>Once year 2566 hits, all Southern Cross crew will be entitled to a free coffee.</p>

<p><b>New Bluespace “Angle” Suspected</b></p>

<p>VirGov researchers stationed in northern Kaltsandur reported anomalous bluespace readings hinting at a previously unknown “angle” within bluespace. Said “angle” may be related to the pattern of anomalous incidents which semi-regularly strike NLS Southern Cross. </p>
<p>”The best way we can put this without getting too technical is there are certain ‘angles’ in bluespace readings which can suggest uncharacterized space. It’s similar to the breakthrough that allows long-distance FTL travel between black holes,” the researchers stated when asked for comment. “The readings here suggest previous investigations into the bluespace anomalies have missed something significant. The breakthrough came when we saw a spike and contacted NanoTrasen to check for anomalous activity.”</p>
<p>NanoTrasen corroborated the story, stating a shadekin incursion during the period of unusual activity.</p>

<p><b>NanoTrasen to Retire Beepsky</b></p>

<p>Officer Beepsky, NanoTrasen’s infamous security bot mascot, is once again slated to be retired. As with last time (and the time before that), NT cited software bugs and a tendency to worsen security incidents as reasons to do away with the whisky-powered stun-baton-on-wheels.</p>
<p>NT has so far refused to elaborate further, though months of complaints on unofficial forums suggest “some guy in corporate really likes Beepsky and hands out promotions to anybody claiming to fix him.” Speculation of course, but entirely in line with NanoTrasen’s track record.</p>
<p>Beepsky is expected to disappear in the following months, at least until later reinstated.</p>

<p><b>The Future of Atmospherics (Sponsored by NanoTrasen)</b></p>

<p>If airlocks are modern, then NanoTrasen’s new atmospheric retention field must be cutting edge! Revealed just a few days ago, NT’s new atmospheric management system projects powerful holograms which keep air in but don’t get in the way of traffic. Unlike fire doors, you can walk right through retention fields as if they don’t even exist.</p>
<p>Atmospheric retention fields are compatible with both old and new station, ship, and vessel designs; all you need is a suitable power source! Strip away those ugly steel shutters and upgrade to power-projected field effects today!</p>
<p>Warning lights and pressure/temperature indicators will be implemented in a future release.</p>

<p><b>Invasive Grubs Discovered on Sif</b></p>

<p>A species of invasive, asteroid dwelling-grub has just been spotted digging through Sif. Known as oregrubs, these dog-sized creatures resemble grubs and are known for eating silicates and precious minerals. Usually encountered in deep space mining operations, oregrubs were thought incapable of surviving Sif’s atmosphere.</p>
<p>Along with giant spiders , cold-adapted slimes, Tymisian moths, and numerous species of bass, the oregrub is the latest entry in the list of off-planet invasive species which threaten the planetary ecosystem. While ecologists state eradication would be ideal, oregrubs can prove dangerous when threatened and should be approached only be trained professionals.</p>
<p>While resembling the better known solargrub, it remains unknown of the species are related.</p>

<p><b>Body-Shape Friendly Clothing Success Continues</b></p>

<p>Clothing designed for unusual body shapes continues to successfully proliferate throughout frontier systems. Perhaps due to the sheer number of frontier crew with two arms and four legs, clothing made for such shapes continues to sell out as soon as released.</p>
<p>Initially sparked by the success of teshari brands, the non-traditional clothing market recently shifted focus to six-limbed customers. Current market prospects suggest this may expand to even more species, though fashion trends have always been notoriously difficult to predict in advance.</p>

<p><b>Veiling Light Circus Appears in Sif </b></p>

<p>A mysterious criminal syndicate known as the Veiling Light reportedly surfaced in Vir this weekend. NLS Southern Cross personnel claimed a demonic circus kidnapped the entire station and forced the crew to complete twisted challenges and face eternal damnation if unsuccessful. Reports around the galaxy corroborates the crew’s testimony, as the incident was apparently streamed.</p>
<p>”This group has always remained countless steps ahead of law enforcement. Years later, we still have nothing to follow but eyewitness testimony,” an official VirGov official responded to a request for comment. “They’ve appeared throughout the galaxy and always put on some sort of horrific gameshow. There’s never evidence other than victim testimony and viewings of the streamed events.”</p>
<p>Despite reports of streaming, no recording of the group’s theatrics has ever been obtained and no evidence of a stream has ever been found. This has led law enforcement to speculate about the use of advanced technology without any known modern equivalent.</p>

<p><b>NanoTrasen Supports the Arts (Sponsored by NanoTrasen)</b></p>

<p>In order to show its support for the arts, NanoTrasen will now be providing employees with access to painting canvases! No longer will crew need to paint on the floor, now Southern Cross personnel can take their vision to actual painting easels!</p>
<p>With so many of the crew intent on painting pictures across floor tiles, NT felt compelled to enable their star employees with creative opportunity! Just like the previously-implemented literary program, crew can show off their best work in the library instead of across the floors!</p>
<p>Rumors about a fine increase for defacing the station are completely untrue.</p>

<p><b>NanoTrasen Tech Gets a Makeover… Again</b></p>

<p>In order to keep everything cutting edge, NanoTrasen announced that it will shortly unveil a redesign of its emitter brand of high-powered laser. What comes with this redesign? A sleek new look coupled with… nothing. Much like the company’s previous redesigns, this is yet another entry in its “switch up the looks without improving anything” marketing scheme.</p>
<p>As the saying goes, everything old is new again, and tweaking looks while changing nothing else is as old as capitalism itself. Of course, I can’t fault the corporation too much because sales are indeed back up since we continue the centuries-old trend of falling for depthless marketing gimmicks. At least this one hasn’t yet inspired a fan war over which model looks the best.</p>
<p>In any event, let’s keep our fingers crossed that the power cell redesign finally comes through without fanfare. Given NT has been advertising that one for years now, we can expect a lot of development hell in whatever eventually ends up on the market.</p>

<p><b>Study Detects Significant Increase in Nightmare Frequency</b></p>

<p>Recent reports of recurring nightmares throughout New Reykjavik have spurred a group of researchers to investigate the phenomenon. After months of tracking, the team determined a statistically significant three-fold increase in nightmares, though nightmares remain uncommon enough that the overall number remains low.</p>
<p>”Usually we find nothing significant whenever investigating anecdotal case reports, or at most a small variance like 10%. But a 306% increase like we found here? We weren’t expecting such success,” the group stated when reached out to for comment. “It may support the idea that areas of increased bluespace activity influence dreams. Vir is currently in the uptick of its bluespace solar cycle so that could be why these data hold water.”</p>
<p>Residents remain skeptical of the researchers’ claims, frequently insisting incidents at NLS Southern Cross are to blame. Given Sif’s general mistrust toward NanoTrasen, however, these accusations should be taken with a grain of salt.</p>

<p>More gambling and alcohol? Really? Is that all NanoTrasen can offer employees to make up for awful working conditions? Week after week Southern Cross seems to be in the news thanks to disaster after disaster. Except today, now it’s in the news because the Golden Space Goose is back in Ullran and this is just too much.</p>
<p>If you’re unaware of this travelling den of vice and debauchery, the titular Space Goose is a travelling luxury space cruiser home to a likewise travelling casino. Alcohol, gambling, strippers, and other unmentionable things behind closed curtains, this depraved vessel seems to be the only thing NT can provide to keep the crew from striking. Is it because they take a cut off the profits? NT crew working this casino should be answer enough!</p>
<p>Stop falling for their tricks, people! It’s time to write to VirGov and outlaw these dens of sin once and for all!</p>

<p><b>Trafficking Harem Reported in Vir</b></p>

<p>Reports emerged this weekend regarding a trafficking ring making rounds throughout Vir, allegedly lingering near Sif and Kara. Posing as a travelling harem, the ring reportedly lures patrons with promises of enjoyment then abducts anybody unable to pay the fee to leave.</p>
<p>”Such schemes frequently pop up among frontier systems,” stated a VirGov Public Services spokesperson. “Lack of SolGov policing often leaves frontier systems understaffed with upholding law and order. Thus ships like these pop up as it’s much easier for them to slip under our radar our here versus the core systems.”</p>
<p>VirGov is requesting anybody with information about the trafficking ring to contact the local authorities. The only released information so far Is the ring appears to be based out of a ship last seen orbiting Sif.</p>

<p><b>Realspace Instability Grows (Guest Interview)</b></p>

<p>Anomalous space-based fluctuations abound across Sif’s Ullran Expanse. While hardly a new phenomenon, a year-long study of the surrounding area reported a hundred-fold increase in bluespace turbulence over the course approximately six months.</p>
<p>”These numbers are unlike anything we’ve seen in a previously characterized area,” reported Shhokla Ezur, the lead author of the study. “While not unprecedented in a newly discovered or unmeasured location, we’ve never found such a spike in activity in somewhere as well-studied as Ullran. Curiously, the data suggest a link to NanoTrasen’s Southern Cross, though we lack data on the installation itself.”</p>
<p>Several commentators have been quick to draw a link between the study results and the anomalous occurrences at NLS Southern Cross. Perhaps further study will draw a definitive answer about the infrequent events.</p>
<p>The full interview can be found on our exonet site.</p>

<p><b>Assailants Battle Over Southern Cross</b></p>

<p>A firefight broke out across NLS Southern Cross this weekend, allegedly involving at least two rival mercenary factions. While NanoTrasen claims to have identified both groups, it has not offered an explanation as to why the factions targeted the station. According to crew reports, the factions apparently used the station to attack one another, treating the crew as collateral damage.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the station suffered heavy damage and casualties but reportedly less than typical. “The crew seemed to hold the line enough to fight back and deal damage to the invaders,” stated an official NT spokesperson. “We were alerted to the situation much earlier than usual and recorded less damage to the station. The ERT expected much more of a bloodbath.”</p>
<p>While not the first time Southern Cross has been a staging ground for battling mercenaries, the motives remain unclear. No faction has claimed credit for the battle, though it is worth noting the infamous Syndicate rarely takes credit for attacks which fail to deal tremendous damage to NanoTrasen installations.</p>

<p><b>Trafficking Targets NanoTrasen Crew</b></p>

<p>Reports of a trafficking ring targeting NLS Southern Cross surfaced yesterday, testing the facility’s lackluster security. Allegedly armed with teleportation devices, the perpetrators simply teleported hapless crew to a processing facility to be stripped and sold for ransom or as black-market goods. NanoTrasen maintains that any crew not recovered were resleeved but it remains unknown how many crew may now have other selves sold into slavery.</p>
<p>Commonly called “abductors,” such trafficking rings are rare on the frontier but not unheard of, resulting in many horror stories (somewhat rightfully) circulating about the fates of their victims. Whether or not such rings are part of a large organization is unknown but considered unlikely due to the rarity of such attacks.</p>
<p>The average person on Sif (or the Karan colonies, for that matter) has little to fear as such incursions are exceptionally rare outside of isolated locales. The average NT employee however would be rightfully afraid given the isolated nature of Southern Cross and the success of this weekend’s incursion. It will be up to NanoTrasen to prevent this from happening again; we all know how that will go.</p>
