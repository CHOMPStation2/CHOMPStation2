<p>===Unathi Black Egg Plague At Record High! (powered by NanoTrasen)===</p>

<p>The Hegemony High Council has released a statement today confirming what has been circulating amongst the circles of the unathi population: Black Egg Syndrome has been at an all time high, at thirteen percent and rising.
<p>For readers who are unaware, this is a condition that mainly targets unathi females, sympthoms include unathi egg clutches including one or several eggs which are covered in a dark, hard, leather like substance, which makes hatching for the young skinks next to impossible thanks to how solid the egg is compared to normal. Often times this will result in the egg being left for dead in the wild, and the female is reclassified as male due to their cultural value decreasing.</p>

<p>Beyond confirming what was suspected, Hegemony, as well as Solgov officals, have declined to comment. Skrellian officals, meanwhile, have remarked that they would seek a cure for this deliberating condition, as a token of goodwill after the war years earlier involving the Hegemony, Skrell, and Solgov.</p>

<p>Obituary - Pablo Jenner</p>

<p>Pablo Jenner passed away while fighting giant space bears during a mining expedition on the evening of October 10th, 2563, at the age of 76. He will be greatly missed for his service. He has lived a rich life of mining on various planets and moons, and continued on even after losing his legs to other creatures, he was a real trooper.</p>

<p>His last words were to a certain Margaret and it said: "Tell her she's a bitch."</p>

<p>Respects can be paid at the Yawn Wider Colony, where his remains are currently kept.</p>

<p>===Tragic Tram Crash on Virgo 3B!  (powered by NanoTrasen) ===</p>

<p>Tragic news from Virgo 3B today. The orange line tram's automated brakes failed to engage when arriving at one of the waystations on the route. The resulting crash ended up destroying the small station's tram terminal, as well as the tram car itself. The automated systems however, did not pick up on the crash until much later, reporting that the train was still moving as normal. It wasn't until crewmembers aboard the next stop on the line, Yawn Wider Station, noticed that the tram was mysteriously missing, that technicians realized what had happened.</p>

<p>The tram contained two passengers, Sabel Hall, 34, Human; and Farket Mrrhalka, 21, Tajara. Only Sabel's body has been located at this time, though the explosion, coupled with the harsh environment, leads investigators to presume that Farket was also killed.</p>

<p>A memorial service will be conducted for the victims of the tragic accident on their home colony. In the meantime, technicians begun repairs on the orange line, and, in the meantime, workers should use short range teleporters, or a different tram line, to make it to and from their workplace</p>

<p>Spooky celebrations: The capital city on Sol IIIᵃ  is due to begin the 2563 celebration of its annual "Festival of Spirits", a 45 day long celebration of various cultures' supernatural-centric holidays. The festival kicks off with Earth's american region holiday "Halloween" on day one, followed by its neighbor to the south's "Día de Muertos" (Day of the dead) on day two. For a full list, see exonet address sol.luna.spiritfest.nt. New entries into the line-up this year include an performance enactments of Hawaii, Earth's "Nightmarchers", and Doradus IV's temperate zone holiday "Eve of the Seafolk"</p>

<p>Mystery probe: An uncrewed probe of mysterious make and origin has been detected at the fringes of NanoTrasen space. Reportedly, it does nto match the construction materials or techniques of any galactic power, and governments and corporations alike are denying involvement in the machine's manufacture and operation. Just as soon as it was detected, the probe enabled a series of stealth systems one-by-one including heat sinks, subspace radio jamming, EM field scattering, and what is theorized to be an advanced form of spacetime distortional phasing until it finally escaped detection.</p>

<p>Box Office Record Scared to Death: The new Horror holofilm "Alone in the void", in which a multi-species crew on a station outside of reliable communications range must fight to survive a power failure, while attempting to decipher the mystery of who, or what, is killing personnel one by one, opened to an astounding 517 billion thalers, after the success of a long, extensive exonet viral marketing ARG spanning an area of 39 systems. Contestants had to find public exonet terminals with notes adhered to them, dig up buried cases of clues, and in one instance, actually space walk on an asteroid covertly registered by the studio under the name of a non-existent small mining company.</p>

<p>NanoTrasen Announcement - 12/11/2563</p>
<p>===NT VEGA BRANCH BOARD OF DIRECTORS ANNOUNCEMENT==</p>
<p>Message to all NanoTrasen personnel employed in the Virgo-Erigone sector,</p>

<p>Dear employees,</p>

<p>As the new fiscal year approaches, the board of directors will be announcing sweeping changes to multiple facets of the corporate guidelines, regulations and policies. These new changes will be broadcasted on all NanoTrasen facilities in the Virgo-Erigone sector on Saturday, the 14th of December 2563. The changes will come effect as they are announced.p>

<p>Glory to NanoTrasen.</p>

<p>===VEGA Sector in Shambles after Mercenary Involvment===</p>

<p>The Virgo-Erigone sector of NanoTrasen got a pretty rough day, reports have been coming of new policy changes which have sparked riots throughout the entire sector. It turns out those new policies were enacted by members of the board who happened to have links with a mercenary organization that is tied to diverse companies. We do not know who hired these men specifically however. But whatever it was, their plan worked. NT has lost Virgo-3b after the Trade Wind Freighter collided with it at half light speed. Causing the entire Moon, and ship, to be completely obliterated. Including all facilities within, and those orbiting it.</p>

<p>Many facilities managed to launch escape ships with the crew escaping thanks to a early warning system, some have flown all the way to nearby planets, where it appears mercenaries were waiting for them. Early Search and Rescue units reports having seen many naked corpses strewn about, with crewmembers wearing their outfits.
The death toll is reported to be above the thousands, no numbers have been released yet.
Most of the workforce from those areas have been relocated to other sectors.</p>

<p>=== Have Carp, Will Travel ===</p>

<p>Reports from around the outer rims tells tales of the dreaded Space Carp breaching their way through atmospheres and hitting the surfaces of many villages, facilities, and other inhabited areas. Details suggest that upwards of hundreds of Space Carp are making landfall each hour, quickly adapting to the new environments they are invading. On a newly christened NanoTrasen outpost, Cryogaia, there were reports of upwards of forty unique Space Carps patrolling around the area of the outpost. They were seen actively engaging wildlife, showing little regard for their own safety.</p>

<p>NanoTrasen Navy released a short statement in regards to the carp, as follows: "...In relation to the Carps, we'll be shortly putting up small, automated anti-air defenses on many of our outposts, capable of shredding a school of Space Carp within moments. Given they are considered Invasive, our internal Native Enrichment department determines this as acceptable action." Time will tell if these methods are to prove useful, or if they'll make the issues worse.</p>

<p>=== Chill Out ===</p>

<p>NanoTrasen's new automated micro-AA batteries have been a resounding success: Counteless chunks of meat have been splattered around many favilities, and no carp have been spotted. Many activists are quick to point out that some of them may be local wildlife capable of flight, though NanoTrasen has given no official response, besides a rumor, saying that: "There were no confirmed reports of Avians<i>[sic]</i>, and if there were, it doesn't matter now."</p>

<p>One side effect that has been noted by the NanoTrasen Navy's Native Enrichment department, is with the abundance of shredded carp meat laying around the new Cryogaia outpost, normally underground dwelling Frost Spiders have come out from their burrows, feating upon the plentiful carp organic confetti. The toxins within the carp, however, cause the frost spiders to have lowered body activity, until the inevitably die of exposure as their body fails to keep up with the rapidly changing conditions, unable to heat themselves up.</p>

<p>NanoTrasen Navy's Native Enrichment department released a statement in regard to this development, "... We're more than sure that they [frost spiders] will be able to quickly adapt to carp toxins, after a liberal deployment of 'stable mutagen' canisters in known hives."</p>

<p>Only time will tell if the spiders will be able to develop an immunity, or if they'll continue to die out on the surface.</p>

<p>===Mystery Probe Update (powered by NanoTrasen)===</p>

<p>A small update to the probe spotting we reported on last in October. The object, or one of similar make and model has been spotted in a system approximately 3471 LY away from the location of the initial sighting. It has been determined that the probes create a small, but unique form of "eddy" in subspace upon arrival. Reportedly, an NT Navy Laboratory is working on a detection system specifically calibrated to alert information networks upon the arrival of similar objects, in hopes of determining their purpose and origin.</p>

<p>===Strange phenomena from around NT space! (powered by NanoTrasen)===</p>

<p>A series of bizarre events reported from around the holdings. A detailed report on this one, as well as several not included here, can be found on the hotlink list located at exonet address NTspacegen.phenomlist21942.ZZZSerg.NT</p>

<p>Plague of nightspiders: Following several days of unusual sun-blocking heavy overcast at the Borealis 1 mining and research outpost, the facility was recently sieged by a large migration of local arachniform animal species nearly ten times the population of the expected norms. Fortunately, on-site NT and externally contracted security consisting of Officers Tenali, Kurkivor Snowstrider, Joel Johnson, and Alex Maktzandt were ln-site to head up the defense.  We attempted to reach each of them for comment via e-mail.</p>

<p>Officer Snowstrider had the following to say: "We lost a few good people who decided to recklessly charge into battle. I'm just glad we had a good few more there to back me up. Certainly was the worse wall breach I've ever seen."<br>
  "Command better ok my turret network idea! [The facility] would be safe from another attack like that.", said Johnson.<br>
  Said Tenali, "Psh, I killed like 30 of them while dragging the fools back to medical, lost count after 50. Was it stressful? Nah, I had a laser gun and 5 batteries! Certified spider slaying equipment."<br>
  Officer Maktzandt declined to comment.</p>

<p>===BREAKING: High energy physics disaster! (powered by NanoTrasen)===</p>

<p>A Nanotrasen Navy-funded research facility, which will go unnamed, has experienced a disaster following experimentation into alternatives to current gateway technology. A core laboratory equipment failure resulted in a phenomena described by the facility AI, the only survivor of the incident, as a "gateway storm", a series of spatial vortexes, potentially interdimensional ones. The "gateway storm" in question translocated a series of new, previously unseen plants and animals, many of them hostile, into the facility. As of this report, Nanotrasen Marine teams have regained control of a portion of the facility and are working with the AI to secure the site until corporate authorities determine the next course of action.</p>
